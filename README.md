## About

Following the guidelines of the [Coding Challenges blog](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-load-balancer), the goal of this project is the development of a **_load balancer_**.

A load balancer sits in front of a group of servers and routes client requests across all of the servers that are capable of fulfilling those requests.

Load balancers can work at different levels of the OSI seven-layer network model. Weâ€™re going to focus on a layer seven - application load balancer, which will route HTTP requests from clients to a pool of HTTP servers.

## Set up

Download the application repository:

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/mariollesta/my-own-loadbalancer.git
```
On the other hand, open your favorite terminal application to be able to execute the corresponding files. You will need to have several tabs to be able to run the balancer, the servers and the client curls.
